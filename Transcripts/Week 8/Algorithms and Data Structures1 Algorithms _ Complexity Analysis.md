In  the  last  week,  we  took  a  wide  look  into  how  to  develop  applications  based  on databases. Using various programming languages, tools, frameworks we tried to give you an overview of the rapid development process, what it needs to do applications on the web as well as on the mobile.

As I told earlier, we would now again step back into the core of database design and if you  recollect  what  we  have  primarily  done  in  the  earlier  weeks,  we  have  started  by focusing on the logical design. We talked about two primary design aspects. One is the logical  design,  which  is  conceptual,  which  deals  with  entities  relationships,  different constraints, their representation, the algebra, calculus, everything. And the other aspect is a physical design, as to how will the bits and bytes be organized so that you can have an efficient storage and an efficient access. So, it is now time to start discussing that.

<!-- image -->

For that we will have to study some of the storage options, or not some maybe a wide range of storage options, that have evolved over time and what is  available today. We have to study how in this typical storage you can organize the data, how you can make the accesses and storage efficient by things like indexing and so on.

So, keeping that target in mind I just thought that it will be good to give a little bit of recap to you on what is efficiency, what we mean by efficiency of access, what we mean by efficiency of storage, how can we compare different ways of doing accesses, different ways of organizing data in terms of its access time, in terms of its storage requirement.

This, truly this is, these are topics in the algorithms course which you may have already studied. So, I have kept it very brief over the first 3 modules of this week, and I will start today by defining just, I mean, most of it will be recapitulation for you but just putting in context from the algorithms course as to, and the data structure course as to what we will frequently need in the design of the physical databases. So, we will start by looking at algorithms and programs and then the different issues of analysis and particularly coming to the asymptotic notation and some complexity of common algorithms.

So, as you know, formally an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined steps. The sequence has to be finite and every step has to be well defined, unambiguous to solve a class of specific problems, or to perform a computation. You want to achieve a task, so you define a sequence of instructions which are already known to you and those which are unambiguous and well defined, and by doing those steps one by one, maybe in just a sequential order or maybe repeating them, you will be able to achieve that task.

Now,  more  often  the  instructions  are  computer  implementable  but  we  also  write algorithms which are more like for human understanding and you can find an equivalent representation algorithm which is computer implementable. But the key point about an algorithm is, and this question is often asked in the interview as to what is the difference between an algorithm and a program, the key point of an algorithm is it must terminate.

An algorithm given an input must give me the output in finite time. That time may be very long, that time may be milliseconds, it could be seconds, could be hours, months or even years, millenniums, but it provably must terminate. That is a key point.

In contrast, a program is a collection of instructions very similar to algorithms which are necessarily to be executed by a computer. That is the reason the computer programmers write  programs  in  a  certain  computer  language,  so  we  say  that  programs  implement algorithms. And the characteristics of a program which would often distinguish it from an algorithm is the fact that a program may or may not terminate.

Now, for example you will ask, I mean, how is it that a program may not terminate. It is quite possible, for example think about the operating system working in your desktop or in your mobile phone. They never end. If the operating system ends, the system is dead. So,  they,  as  long  as  you  have  the  computer  system,  you  have  an  operating  system running. Your database system does not stop. It will have to keep running. So, these are programs which do not terminate, but they embody algorithms which must terminate.

Now, the question is, we often know about analysis of algorithms, we often talk about analysis of algorithms. So, there are a couple of w questions on this which is very typical as to why should you analyze, what is the motivation, why do you actually analyze an algorithm. Then the question is what do you analyze, what identify, what all factors that need to be analyzed.

Once you have done that, then you need certain techniques, tools to analyze. So, you try to  answer  how  to  analyze.  Then  you  ask  the  question  where  to  analyze,  what  are  the scenarios, would you analyze it for all possible inputs or for some sample inputs, what are  the  scenarios,  where  do  you  identify  the  scenarios  to  analyze,  that  is,  where  to analyze. And the last question is, would you keep on analyzing an algorithm all the time or  there  is  a  point  when  you  stop  analyzing  algorithms  and  finding  newer  algorithms because you may be able to realize whatever best is even theoretically possible, that is when to analyze.

Now, leaving aside when to analyze because it involves quite a lot of theory in terms of lower bounds and you know NP completeness, and all that, so which is not relevant for our database discussion. You must have studied them in the algorithm course. I would try to take you quickly through these four points which you, I am sure know in some way or other already.

(Refer Slide Time: 07:50)

So, why you analyze? Because resources are scarce. I mean, because we always want to do more with less. We greed for, do more with less. We want to avoid performance bugs. So,  these  are  the  reason  we  will  try  to  analyze.  So,  the  core  issues  is  to  predict performance, as to how much time does binary search tree take, or binary search take if I have two algorithms for the same task. Like, for sorting an a set of data in an array, you have innumerable algorithm, Quicksort, Mergesort, (Buck) Bucket Sort, Insertion Sort,

Selection Sort, Heap Sort, you, you name it. So, you need to compare the algorithms and decide which one should we use.

Then you want to prove, provide guarantees, that okay, if I do it in this way, if I use a Red-Black tree then I would always be able to insert a key, insert a record in my database in order n log n type, whatever that means. We want to understand the theoretical basis. That is what I was saying, lower bounds and all that. So, there are these are the primary reasons why you analyze.

Now, the question is what you analyze? You analyze for resources taken, given an input size. So, your parameter is the input size, which could be the number of elements in the input, which could be the size of the input, which could be the value of the input, which could be multiple inputs, but that is your parameter. And what do you measure? What do you want to measure, is the resource which is important for you.

So, the whole history of computing analysis started with analysis of time. It started with the  analytical  engine  of  which  I  have  just  put  the  picture  here,  is  fun,  so  the  most common  analysis  factor  is  the  time,  but  there  could  be  several  others.  For  example, storage. Space is also very critical in many places, for example, in handheld devices, in databases because databases are very, very large.

So, if you can save some even 10 percent space, you save a lot of money. But there could be other factors to analyze also. For example, power I think I mentioned it earlier as well, that  handheld  devices  are  power,  I  mean,  power  constrained,  so  you  need  to  possibly trade  off  other  resources  in  favor  of  power.  You  may  want  to  optimize  for  bandwidth because you may not have enough bandwidth, a 4G bandwidth to connect to your server. You may have a 2G bandwidth.

So,  you  may  want  to  minimize  on  processor  resources  in  a  extremely  multi-threaded distributed application and so on. So, there are various different things to analyze. In this context, for the context of database that we are targeting we will only focus on the time and space for now.

(Refer Slide Time: 10:54)

So, what you analyze, this is just taking an example. This is a very standard algorithm for, written in terms of a C program, for making the sum of n numbers. So, this n is your input  size.  So,  that  is  the  parameter.  And  what  do  you  measure? You want to measure how much time it will take.

Now, you cannot measure each and everything in an algorithm because there is a time to create the stack for this particular function, there is time for making this assignment, there is time for taking the comparison, doing this decrement and so on. But what you try to identify are the key tasks, key operations that you must do in doing this algorithm.

And that key here, since you are trying to find out sum, is the addition operation. And you can also kind of reason that the number of times you need to add, your number of comparisons and number of decrements, here will be related to that because every time you go through the for loop you do a comparison, you do a decrement. And if it succeeds you do an addition.

So, these are very closely related. So, approximately, I can say that if I know the number of additions being done, I know how much time will it take the number of additions times the typical time of doing an addition multiplied by a maybe a scale factor. So, if I just count that this loop will go over n times so the time is Tn, which is n additions.

And what is the space? Space is simply the n where you keep the number and the storage s.  Of  course,  there  is  additional  space  in  terms  of  temporaries  and  all  that,  which  we grossly ignore in terms of doing this analysis because it turns out to be comparable to the user variables that you have. So, you have two variables so space is two. So, this is, this is what you analyze.

So, if we take another example quickly, this is finding a character in the string. So, what you are doing is, you are writing a, this is, the pointer to the string, this is the character that you want to find, and you go over that string starting with the index 0, so you are trying  to  check  str  0,  str1,  like  this,  and  how  far  do  you  go?  You  go  up  to  strlen(str), which gives you the length of the string.

So, those many characters are there, those many times you have to do. So, those many times this loop will have to execute, and for each c, if it, if the character is c, equal to c or not. If it is equal, you return, you are done. If it is, not then you return a 0, saying that you did not get it.

Now, given this, so your, what is the input complexity? Input complexity is the size of the string. The longer the string, you need more time. So, your complexity parameter is n. Now, what is that you get to do? Naturally, again the key, you are trying to see for match, so the key operation is compare. So, you have, and this loop can go on variable number of times depending on where you find the character.

So, what you try to say? You try to say, okay, what is the maximum possible, what is the worst possible scenario I can get into, which we will discuss in subsequent slides also, and for that, you know that if the character does not exist at all, then you will have to go through  the  entire  string.  So,  you  said  that  it  could  be  at  the  worst,  it  could  be  n comparisons, n comparisons.

Now, every time you go over this loop, you do strlen(str). So, it also has the, n times it has to do strlen(str), so whatever time that takes, you will also have to take that. Now, what is strlen(str)? It has to count, going one after the other. There is no other way. You have  to  count  or  keep  on  seeing,  keep  on  incrementing  an  index  till  you  get  a  null character which is a c string terminator.

So, every time you do this you have n. So, what you get, n comparisons plus n times n increments because you have to go through that index, and every time you go through the loop you have to do this. So, it turns out to be n plus n square. And if n square starts going  large  then  I  can  say  this  is  approximately  n  square.  So,  we  will  say  this  is  a quadratic algorithm.

What is your space? Your space requirement is the, input is str and i, c and you have just the i. So, space requirement is still very negligible. Now, that is where you can see the benefit of doing the analysis. For example, you are just checking in the string. So, the string does not change as you go over the loop. So, strlen(str), value that you will get, the first time, the second time, the third time, the nth time, will all be the same.

Then you are basically losing efficiency but, by computing it several times unnecessarily. So, what you could do? You could remove this and before that loop you could say len assigned  strlen(str).  And  make  this  length.  Then  what  will  happen?  This  will  get computed in n, and you will not need this strlen time after that. So, this will turn out to be n+n, which is, which will be n. So, from quadratic it will become linear. A very simple one  statement  change  can  drastically  improve  your  algorithm  and  that  is  what  you analyze for the time and the space.

So,  there  are  a  couple  of  more  examples,  that  I  have  provided  here,  like  finding  the minimum of a sequence of numbers like in, in different ways so that you can see how you are actually getting the improvement, and you can go through them and practice. So, this is what, this is what you look for.

(Refer Slide Time: 17:37)

<!-- image -->

Now, the question, question is how do you do it? How do you given a, given an algorithm or a program source, how would you do the analysis? It is not a trivial question. Now, there  are  different  models.  One is  counting  model.  Like,  whatever  we were  doing  is  a counting model. We are just observing and seeing, okay this is, this is, what likely, likely to  be  you  know  more  dominant,  let  us  count  how  many  times  it  can  happen.  It  is  not always easy to do that.

Also, given the, given the, all different kinds of instruction you could have, the counting could turn out to be a very complex formula. So, we do something of an approximation which we say is an asymptotic analysis. So, these are some of the basic methods. And then you have, particularly since several algorithms are recursive, it is very difficult to do accounting reasoning on them.

So, what you do, you write corresponding recurrence relations, use generating functions to solve them and get an idea about the complexity number, or there is, for a large class of problems, large class of recursive decomposition, you have a basic theorem known as the masters theorem. So, this is dominantly useful for recursive algorithms and, and since we are not doing an algorithms course I am keeping this aside because we just need the basic results to go forward.

(Refer Slide Time: 19:19)

<!-- image -->

So, we have already seen some part of the counting model where we try to find out the frequency  of  different  operations,  get  an  estimate  about  the  cost  and  then  your  total running time, or total space, total running time is a sum of cost times frequency for all operations. And for this, we use a simple random-access machine model where we know the input data and size, we can identify the operations which are known a priori, and we can identify the intermediate stages, and we look at output data and size.

And  the  maximum  of  these,  that  is  certainly  you  will  need  to  read  the  input.  Not certainly, in most cases. There are problems where you do not need the need to read the entire  input.  And  you  will  need  to  write  the  output,  and  you  will  need  to  do  the operations. So, the maximum of these three will give you the complexity, and that is the basic approach to analysis because if you have to read the input then you cannot have a complexity less than the input size. If you have to write the output then you cannot have an complexity which is less than the output size.

So, the first one we call input complexity, based on this, I am sorry, this is called input complexity,  this  is  called,  because  you  will  have  to  write  the  output,  in  any  case, complexity, and whatever operations complexity. So, the max of these, or basically the sum of these, I am saying max because something will dominate anyway, so, is the total complexity. And that is how you, you analyze.

So, this is just a factorial example. This is written recursively. I am not using generating function, but it is very easy to see that you have to find factorial n, it is n times factorial n minus  1  so  this  will  go  down  to  factorial  0  or  factorial  1,  factorial  0,  which  I  know explicitly as 1.

So, n times this call will be made. It is very clear. So, n times a call will be made means this  multiplication will be done n-1 times because the first call  with n does not have a multiplication. So, it is n-1 multiplication but it needs a lot of space because as you keep on calling none of these functions are returning.

So, the call stacks, it is called I mean, I am sorry, activation records or stack frames keep on staying on the stack so there are, n+1 stacks the, the, the caller, the n invocations of the factorial will be there. So, there will be, the space will be of the order of n+1 times a constant because every stack frame will take a size. n-1 is the number of multiplications, times a constant is your time.

But  if  you  write  this  simply  in  an  alternate  iterative  form  where  you  start  not  from  n down to 1 but you just keep on multiplying from 1 up to n, if you just do that, as in here, then obviously again you will have n multiplications but you will just need one function call,  in  this  function  itself.  So,  all  that  you  need  is  n  and  t.  So,  you  can  see  that  just moving  from  this  to  this  you  make  a  great  advantage  by  reducing  your  space significantly. So, this is, earlier we showed an example where you were able to reduce your time, here is an example where you can show that you can reduce your space. So, this is how you analyze typically in terms of a counting model.

<!-- image -->

Now, the core idea is that we cannot often just do comparison in terms of whether it is n or  n+5  and  things  like  that.  The  comparing  actual  times  is  not  a  good  idea,  it  is  not possible. The actual time will depend on the processor resource, I mean, processor clock speed, it will depend on the particular processor architecture, it will depend, depend on the bus speed, and so on so forth.

So, comparing actual, I am sorry, comparing actual time is not an option. So, what you compare is growth. That is what hurts you, because you do not, if n is small, if your input size is small you really do not care how much time a database table will take to look it up because it will be less anyway, whatever way you do it.

If n is large, you really care. So, you want to know that if you keep on increasing n from a small value to a large value, how is your time and space going to grow. It is the growth, that is what you are interested in. And you are not interested in a specific number or a specific function because you cannot compare them.

So,  you  want  a  approximation  of  that,  and  that  is  what  is  known  as  the  function approximation, which we call, which we denote by a Big-Oh notation. There are other complexity  notation,  like  Big-Omega,  Big-Theta,  which  relates  to  the  theory  of  lower bounds,  so  we  are  not  getting  into  those.  Often  you  solve  a  recurrence  in  the  growth function to, to get the growth function. But we will just show you simple examples.

Let us say, this is an example of, there is, there is, what is this trying to do is, is going from 1 to n, you have an array a, and then for every i it is going from i+1 to n and it is checking. So, it  is  basically  checking  on  combinations  to  check  if  the  sum  of  any  two elements is 0 or not, or how many times it is it is 0, how many such sums are 0. So, that functionality you do not really bother about.

Now, the  question  is,  if  we  do  a  counting  model  on  this,  then  you  will  see  that,  how many, what is the frequency of that? You have it one, so I am just trying to look at the variable declarations, the number of times you will have to hit at the declaration. One is

| Operation            | Frequency   | Approximatic   |
|----------------------|-------------|----------------|
| variable declaration | N+2         | N              |
| assignment statement |             | N              |
| less than compare    |             | ~ N?           |
| equal to compare     |             | N?             |
| array access         |             | N              |
| increment            |             |                |

here, one is here, which will happen once, and this will happen multiple times, every time you go, do the outer for loop you will start the inner for loop.

So, you have a declaration to process. So, the outer for loop will happen n times, so the inner for loops int j declaration has to be processed n times. So, this is 1, this is 1, and this is n, which makes the total as n+2. The same thing can be said about the assignments.

So, these are the assignments. Actually, we call it initialization, but in here, it will act as an assignment, which is n+2. How many times you do less than comparison? This is this because you do it, for every time you do it for the outer, you do for the i times for the inner. So, it is, it is 1+2 plus like, 3, sum of natural numbers. So, it is what it is.

Equal to comparison will happen as many times the inner loop can happen, inner loop iteration can happen. This is, this will be the array axis, double of that, two times of that because you have two axes here, and increment will depend on what are your data. It will not  happen  always.  These  increments  are  fixed  but  the  increment  here  would  vary depending  on  the  data.  So,  this  is,  this  is  what  you  get.  So,  this  is  your  total  set  of analysis. So, if you put, sum all of them together you will get a complex quadratic, you can see that n square is a maximum, so you will get a quadratic expression. That is fine.

But what we do? We do we do an approximation. We say that the growth of n+2 and the growth of n are similar. They do not significantly differ in the growth. They will grow in a similar way. Similarly, the growth of this expression and the growth of half n square, or for that matter n square is similar. They will just differ by a small factor but the growth will be the similar.

So, in this way, we, what we do is in simple terms, if it is a, these, these all happen to be polynomials, so what we are doing is in simple terms, we just take the dominant term, the highest degree term and say that is my  tilde(~) approximation, or asymptotic approximation. So, all that you get, all are these approximations. So, what I do, I add up all of them. So, I end up having alpha n times beta n square, where alpha beta will get values. So, this is the approximation.

And then we say that well n square will grow much faster than n. n is linear, n square goes like this. So, I can ignore, for large n, I can ignore alpha n because if n is small they are comparable, and I do not care what happens, with the small input size I do not care what is the complexity.

If it grows large, then this, this gap keeps on increasing. This gap keeps on increasing. So, what matters is the quadratic term, beta n square. So, I can say that alpha n plus beta n square, what is the tilde(~) here is actually beta n square, ignoring the linear term. If I say that, then I can say that, that is actually n square because beta is just a constant factor.

So, that is the whole idea of saying that it is asymptotically n square. We will write this as order  n  square.  What  this  tilde  function  really  means  is  f  is  approximation  to,  g  is  an approximation to n if the limit of f by n, n tending to infinity, is 1. And you can check in every case here that that limit actually is what holds.

So, this is just a chart to show you how does the typical known complexities of 1, which is  constant, log n, which is here, logarithmic linear, linear logarithmic, that is, n log n, quadratic, cubic, you may not be familiar to see these curves in this form because it has been plotted in a log log curve. Your x axis is log, as well as right axis is log. So, that as you  grow  in  the  polynomial  basically  your  line  always  remains  same,  you  are  just changing  the  gradient.  It  is  just  rotating  like  this  and  that  tells  you  how  the  cost  is increasing.

If you would like to look at it in your familiar graph plotting, then this is how it will look like. So, you can see that if something is order n it goes like a straight line, if something is log n it is much less, almost like constant. n log n goes like this, but powers of n go very far, fast. Exponential of n are almost vertical, that with a very small n, it explodes. So,  you  cannot,  these  are  what  you  cannot  afford.  This  is,  maybe  c&gt;2  should  be avoidable. This is preferred, this will be good, and this is excellent. So, that is what, along this axis, that is what we will thrive for. And that is the basic take back from this.

So, this is the formal definition. I am not very concerned about the formal definition. You have done it in the algorithms course. This is just for your reference.

And  finally,  what  do  we,  where  do  we  do  the  analysis?  There  could  be  different situations, but we will focus primarily on these two. The worst case, that is, if I take all possible cases what is the input? That gives me the worst complexity. And also, if I take a any random input, assuming inputs are distributed in a certain distribution, then what is the  expected  running  time  we  will  get.  We  will  typically  talk  of  these  two.  These  are other  forms  of  complexity  analysis  that  exist  but  primarily  databases  or  things  used  in databases, we will primarily focus in the worst case and the average case.

So, I will end with a complexity chart, this is not for you to remember but to refer, where for  the  common  data  structure,  some  of  these  I  am  going  to  discuss  in  the  next  two modules. What are their different access times? So, if you, this is just a quick reference that you can make.

And another is for the sorting algorithms. What are the different complexities you get in the different scenarios, both in terms of time as well as in terms of space?
