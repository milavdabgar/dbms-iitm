Relational Database Design/8: Case Study

Welcome to Module 28 of Database Management Systems course in the IIT Madras online B.Sc. program.

<!-- image -->

We have been discussing about designing of relational database schemas and we have made a lot of studies into that and using the theory of functional dependency we have learned how to model and design good schema with decomposition into 3NF or BCNF. (Refer Slide Time: 00:58) 3

So, it is time to just kind of take a step back and start, we have done a lot of theory. So, what I want to do in this module is take a step back stop discussing theory, but apply what we have learned.  So,  you  must  have  received  the  specification  statement  for  a  library  information system. It is a simple English language document which describe, how a library information system is required.

(Refer Slide Time: 01:35)

<!-- image -->

Now, when you go through this presentation, please keep that document available with you, alongside  with  you.  I  will  accept  the  key  points  from  the  document  here.  But  it  is  also important to understand how to accept the key points. There will be a tutorial on this part as well as to from the specification, how do you come to a kind of more manageable and you know concrete description of the specification.

So, first before we proceed let us identify the tasks. So, we are given to design a relational database  schema  for  a  library  information  system  of  an  institute.  The  specification  system document  you  have.  And  in  this  presentation, we  include  the key  points from  the specification as expert as we as I said, and the tasks are naturally from this description, we have to first identify the entity sets and their attributes.

We have to identify the relationships that is a that is basically we have to carry out the Entity Relationship Modelling for the specification. Once we have the Entity Relationship Model, we  will  transform  that  into  a  set,  initial  set  of  relational  schema.  So,  we  will  generate  a number of relational schema that come from the ER model, then we will have to refine the set of schema with the functional dependencies that hold on them.

So, that our target would be to okay, achieve BCNF in every case, if we cannot, we will try to do 3NF. But considering the functional dependencies, which also the functional dependencies will  not  be  given  in  the  document,  the  functional  dependencies  will  be  hidden  in  the statements of the document and we will have to extract those understanding and put them in the notion, notation of the functional dependencies.

And using those  we will  have to keep  decomposing every  relational  scheme  to  make  sure they  are  in  BCNF.  And  if  not,  at  least  in  3NF.  And  beyond  that  also  we  will  have  to  do something is we will alongside check on what are the possible coding of some of the typical queries, all queries obviously, the designer will not code that's a application programmer's job.

And we might see that my design may need some change. So that certain query can actually be efficiently written. This is a factor which we have not talked about earlier, we have only been talking about the theory part of it, but there are pragmatics part of it. The pragmatics say that  well,  you  may  have  a  very  good  design,  but  unless  you  can  efficiently  write  queries, which is the target, the design will not be appreciable.

So, that is the first final stage that we will make some refinements like this and finalize the design. Of course, then the remaining part of the task is to actually code the various queries which we will not be doing in the module, which I will leave, leave for you as exercise to practice and we have already done a whole lot of SQL query programming.

<!-- image -->

So, let me run through the specification quickly before I get into the design. So, it says that the institute library has some these numbers are not important, it just says that there are large number of books and large number of members and books are naturally regularly issued by members on roll  and  returned after  a  period.  So,  you  immediately  get  an  information  that there will have to be a issue relationship, issue process and that associated with an issue there is a time period.

So, there is a date of return kind of thing that will be involved. And the library needs an LIS. Now if you go through the sentences, you will see that it says that every book has a I mean, it was written in the long longhand English what I have just I have just kind of bulleted them so that it starts looking more like the ER information. So, a book very clearly, the book has to be an entity has a title, author, in case of multiple author the first author so it says that it is not multivalued.

It  has  publisher,  year  of  publication,  ISBN  number  which  is  unique  for  a  publication  and accession number. The difference between them is a say if you consider Silberschatz, Korths book, it has one ISBN number so, all copies of that book has the same ISBN number that is a publication number.

And accession number is if there are 5 copies of that book in the library, then naturally those 5 copies have to be distinguished. So, they will be given separate separate number. So, that is called the accession number. And that is what is highlighted at the end, there may be multiple copies of the book.

(Refer Slide Time: 06:52)

<!-- image -->

Then  you  have  members,  four  categories  of  that  undergraduate,  postgraduate  students, research  students  and  faculty  members.  Student  has  this  is  also  written  in  terms  of  a description  I  have  extracted  out  and  put  it  in  terms  of  bullets,  which  looks  somewhat  like somewhat like your ER entity relationship entity attribute kind of. So, this is going to be an entity and these are going to be the attributes and these three are naturally value constraints.

So, you are saying degree can be undergrad, grad or doctoral nothing else. So, this is a value constraint,  we  have  talked  about  value  constraints earlier  in  terms of  semester  and  all that examples. So, similar things you have here. So, this is a.

(Refer Slide Time: 07:41)

<!-- image -->

Then, then you have faculty with all these properties that faculty has again described, then it makes a very interesting information in terms of the membership, it says library also issues a unique membership to every member. So, you get to know that there has to be a kind of a member entity which has a membership number and every member has a maximum quota for the number of books at a time how many can you issue  and here in when you look here, here in it says what is the quota for each and every type of member.

So, it talked about the type of membership earlier. So, the quota is not based on individual member but it is based on the type of member. These are not explicitly, explicitly tabulatively stated, but these are what you can read, make out from the. And you can know that the quota basically talks about two things one is the number of books and other is a period of, period for which you can actually retain the book. So, so, this is basically you are seeing the entire document.

(Refer Slide Time: 09:03)

<!-- image -->

I am just reading out in forms of excerpts in a compact form. And finally, it says that there are  some  ground  rules.  A  book  maybe  issued  to  a  member  if  it  is  not  already  issued  to someone else, which is trivial. A book may not be issued to a member if another copy of the book  is  already  issued  to  the  member.  So,  this  is  a  constraint,  this  is  a  constraint  being specified.

No issue will be done to a member if at the time of issue, one or more books issued by the member has already exceeded its duration. So, you will have to decide whether, whether you would like to keep this in the database constraints with how convenient is that or whether these  are  constraints  for  the  application  program.  But  these  are  constraints  which  they  are talking about.

No issue will be allowed also if quota is exceeded for the member, this should be. So, this kind  of  a  constraint  will  also  have  to  be  in  place  and  it  is  assumed  that  every  author  or member has two parts in their name, first name and last name. So that this will help us get the atomic domain. Because it says that this is name is a composite attribute we know and it says what are the components we will flatten out and make it simply atomic.

(Refer Slide Time: 10:19)

<!-- image -->

Now,  it  also  talks  about  certain  representative  queries  like  adding,  removing  members, categories  of  members,  books  and  so  on.  Adding,  removing,  editing  quota  of  category  of members, duration and so on. So, all these are basically you have to take each one of them and  you  will  have  to  subsequently,  I  mean  you  will  have  to  see  whether  your  design  can easily, conveniently cater to writing the sequel query for this.

If not, then you have to revise the design and if it does, then at the end, you will have to sit down and write all these queries check if a library has a, so, there are quite a number of them, will take just  representative look at some of these.

<!-- image -->

So, this is about the specification. So, you have got the specifications. Now, you are doing the design in the ER model, I am not presenting the design as in the diagram, as in terms of the diagram rather I am presenting in terms of a text representation. So, very clearly these are the books and these are the different, this is the entity set and these are the different  attributes highlighted that this is composite.

So, this will have to be broken up to get this relation to 1NF and what is given above is the relevant  sentences  from  the  specification  which  you  are  translating  into  this  kind  of  a  ER representation.

(Refer Slide Time: 11:53)

<!-- image -->

You  have  students  which  has  all  these  different  attributes,  this  entity  set  having  all  these attributes and you have a value constraint on this coming from here, which we will have to remember to take care in the later part of the design.

(Refer Slide Time: 12:14)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

Very simple as you see the faculty there is nothing specific to mention except that again name is a composite one. In fact, you can in earlier ones also another point that you should have noted for example, here you can note that this is unique. ER model allows you to note that, because certainly you can have multiple copies, multiple books with the same title, multiple books with the same author, naturally, you can have multiple copies of Korth.

So, which means that all of these can be repeated in the database except the stamping of the specific  copy  which  is  accession  number,  so,  accession  number  is  unique.  So,  this identification of uniqueness is very important as you understand because  you have to after having done the basic extraction of entity and attributes, you will also have to mark the key attributes in the process.

So, similarly in in in students, this is member number it is roll number. So, basically both of them a student will have a unique roll number. So that is what you are noting, the naturally being  a  member  of  this  library,  you  will  have  a  unique  member  number.  So,  that  is  also another key. So, it has two keys. Similarly, faculty will have member number as unique and ID as unique, another constraint written here mobile number maybe null.

And here we are assuming that things like date of joining, date of birth is of date type, since you  have  a  date  type,  so  that  can  be  taken  as  an  atomic  component.  You  do  not  need  to consider that to be composite.

<!-- image -->

Then members, where you have member number, which certainly is unique. And then you have  a  member  type,  which  has  a  constraint  on  the  values  it  can  take  UG,  PG,  research scholar or faculty.

(Refer Slide Time: 14:23)

<!-- image -->

Now you have a quota. So, this is what I was explaining earlier that from this statement you are I mean, it is not clearly quota, quota is not a, I should say it is not a tangible entity, like faculty, student or book are tangible entities you can touch them. But quota is an intangible entity.  It  is  a  notion  it  is  a  kind  of  permission  that  you  give.  So,  it  is  embedded  in  this description.

So,  you  identify  this  is  a  quota  and  what  does  it,  what  all  does  it  depend  on  from  the statement, a quota, to describe a quota you need to know the member type, you need to know how many books and you need to know for how much time. So, these turn out to be your three  attributes  which  are  not  clear,  like  you  had  in  the  description  of  student  or  book  or faculty that is how you get these.

Now, the question obviously is what is the unique? Obviously, member type will have to be unique because you cannot have two different quota for the same member type. So, this is your quota design.

<!-- image -->

Then, it is not mentioned, but you will I mean this these are, these kinds of gaps are very typical in a specification. That when you get the specification, you start doing the design you will ask, okay, all are there students are there, undergraduate, postgraduate, research scholar, faculty,  everybody is there. But how about the staff? How will the library run? There will have to be staff to run the library.

And it is naturally, ridiculous that if the staff who run the library cannot access the library. So, this is kind of possibly we will go back to the client and say that and client say oh my God, I forgot. Thanks for the advice. So, you are trying to not only capture what is written, but at times you are trying to read between the lines in the thought process of the requirement to say that well there has to be staff running.

So,  there  has  to  be  a  staff  entity  as  well.  And  rest  of  it  is  somewhat  guesswork,  which  is speculation, which will have to get ratified from the customer that certainly staff will have a name which is composite in the way, the ID will be there, gender will be there whether the staff is allowed to operate without a mobile or must be with a mobile is a question you will have to ask the customer.

If he or she is allowed to do that, then it can be made to be null, then null will be allowed, date of joining there may be more like you may want to have certain staff positions to decide what kind of membership they will have and so on. So, this is something so, this is something very interesting this is going from specification to the ER model. And what you see is some initially what we said was crisply written in the specification.

Then we saw something like quota which was written in a descriptive form and you have to dig  out  and  then  we  are  talking  about  something  which  is  not  written  at  all,  but  you  are reading between the lines and putting your thought process and that is the contribution you make as a database designer. Otherwise, if this is missed out later on, you will have to come back and make changes very expensive.

(Refer Slide Time: 17:59)

<!-- image -->

Naturally, relationships,  there  could be several types of relationships you can think of,  but you are looking at the library aspect like you can think of relationship between author and title of the book who has written what, author and publisher. But those kinds of relationships you will not, we are not extracting or speculating, but we focus on the fact that it says the books are regularly issued.

So, there will have to be a book issue that is a core purpose of the library and who can issue? A student, faculty or members in general. So, a member number will have to be there for this and  what  can  be  issued?  Our  books  and  what  is  the  uniqueness  on  that  site  is  accession number. So, that you know when we create a binary relationship, we have the key on both sides to connect the relationship.

Now, we need a relationship attribute here. Why do we need relationship attribute? Because when the issue is done at that point of time I need to record the date so that later on I can enforce  the  information  on  quota.  So,  this  is  neither  in  members  relation,  DOI  is  not  in members relation nor in the books relation, but it has to come as an relationship attribute we talked  about  this  earlier.  And  identify  the  type  of  relationship,  type  of  relation  is  naturally many to one because one a book can be issued to only one member, but one member can issue several books.

(Refer Slide Time: 19:51)

<!-- image -->

So, based on this now you can quickly so this is so up to that point was entity relationship diagram. If you feel more comfortable, you can write them down, I mean, you can draw them down in terms of the ER diagrammatic model, but I have just used the textual version. But from this now, you can very quickly dump this entire information in terms of the relational schema.

So, you have the relational schema books, members, quota, students, faculty coming directly from that this is your speculated one. And this is your, this is coming from your relationship. And in each, you can actually mark out what is the key, this is the key book issue. Are both, do  both  need  to  be  key?  No.  You  can  only  have  the  accession  number  because  there  is  a many to one relationship, you may not, do not need this.

Member number is a key, member type is a key. Here member number and roll number are keys,  two  different  not  together.  Faculty  number, ID  are  keys  again,  separately.  Here  staff name, I am sorry, not staff name, the staff ID is a key. If we put member number, then that will also be a key. So, this is a very basic first cut relational schema for the entire LIS system.

(Refer Slide Time: 21:30)

<!-- image -->

So, what we get into is now get into the refinements. So now we will have to see that well, these  are  the  relations  I  have  got,  what  are  the  possible  functional  dependencies  that  are implicit in the statements. So, there was a statement saying that, so, we are looking at books, and there was a statement saying that every publication has a unique ISBN number. So, we get the first dependency.

So, this is the first functional first FD that we get, which says that given ISBN number I know title,  author,  name,  author,  last  name,  publisher,  year  all  that  and  we  also  have  that  every book has a unique stamping of accession number. So, this is the other functional dependency. Clearly in terms of the functional dependency, the key now can be formally be shown to be accession number. 0

Now, the problem that you will get is a Korth, Silberschatz book there are five copies, they have different accession number, but all of these will be common for all these five copies. So, there  is  redundancy  across  this  book  copies.  So,  what  we  should  do,  we  should  try  to normalize. And as we normalize, this is a very straightforward case, which actually by, even by  observation,  you  will  be  able  to  do,  it  is  because  it  is  very  disjointed  part  of  the information.

So, if you look into this, then this does not violate BCNF, but this violates BCNF. This does not violate BCNF because accession number is a key, but the other one will violate BCNF because ISBN number is not the key. So, if we do a BCNF decomposition, we will get these two relations very clearly. So, both  of them  now are in  BCNF because the two functional dependencies one hold on this, the other holds on this, these are the resultant keys both are in BCNF  you  can  check  both  the  functional  dependencies  on  the  decomposition.  So,  it  is  a BCNF  decomposition  lossless  and  dependency  preserving,  very  happy  situation.  So,  your books relationship schema has been normalized and finalized.

<!-- image -->

Then  you  have  book  issue  which  has  member  number,  accession  number  will  decide obviously  the  date  of  issue,  because  why,  why  that  is  required,  why  member  number  is required, I was saying that accession number itself will do, it is not, it may not because the book, same book may be issued to different members at different times.

So, we will have to look at those aspects but actually it is safe to think that this pair, member number  and  accession  number  will  decide  the  date  of  issue  so  that  is  the  key,  the  only functional dependency so this is in BCNF.

(Refer Slide Time: 24:42)

<!-- image -->

Quota, member type will decide maximum books, maximum duration, so member type is a key it is in BCNF.

## (Refer Slide Time: 24:53)

<!-- image -->

Members, very easy to see that member number is the key which decides member type and there is value constraint on the member type. But otherwise, this is in BCNF. Certainly, there is  a  question  as  to  how  do  you  get  the  member  type?  So,  that  question  you  will  have  to answer.

(Refer Slide Time: 25:14)

<!-- image -->

Students, roll number decides everything member number decides roll, roll number decides member number. So, there are two keys and everything is in BCNF. The issue is the member number is needed for issue written queries. So, it is unnecessary to have those details with that. So, it  is  in  BCNF, but it  is  not  a  good,  it may  not  be a good  design,  because do you really need all this information here it is in BCNF because it uniqueness is there. But do you really need to keep all that.

(Refer Slide Time: 25:55)

<!-- image -->

Member number can also come from the faculty. So, similarly member number is common with again in the faculty, it is very easy to see the design it is already in BCNF, but member number can also come from the students how do you differentiate between them.

(Refer Slide Time: 26:09)

<!-- image -->

So, that is where you get into the problem with writing a query. Suppose, you have to get the name of the member who is issued the book having accession number such and such. Now, where would you have to get it from? So, you have to get it from the book issue. Now, if you have to get it from the book issue, So, you are saying accession number is equal to this, this and now, the question is what do you say where do you get the, with this will give you the membership number from the book issue you will get the membership number, but how do you get these details? OF

Because from the membership number you do not know, whether the member is a student or is a faculty. If he is a student, then you will have to look in the students table, if it is a faculty you  have  to  look  in  the  faculty  table.  So,  you  can  see  that,  we  created  a  design  where everything  has  been  made  into  BCNF,  no  redundancy,  nothing,  but  we  have  missed  out somewhere so that we cannot effectively write the simplest query that we need to write; who has issued a book? You do not know which query to fire. 5

<!-- image -->

So, we need refinement. So, how can we refine? We have to see that the members what we have missed out is members need to know more, members need to know whether a member is a student or a faculty this information is nowhere there. So, I have to basically search both these  tables  and  later  on  if  I  have  staff  members  a  third  table  to  see  given  a  particular membership number whether that person is a student or a faculty or a staff.

So, what would be better certainly is to expand the member relationship. So, along with the member number you have something this is now your design attributes are coming this was not stated. Now, you are saying whether member class is student or it is faculty, which we will use to choose the table for the answering the queries.

Then member type will be there and to relate to the details of whether it is student or a faculty you put the roll number or the ID number naturally both cannot be there. I mean rarely, rarely a faculty will also be a student, but usually both will not be there. So, it should be nullable fields. And here by designing this, why did you get this from, it is nowhere written but we got it  from the, again reading between the lines that in the context of the library a student is a member.  So,  and  a  faculty  is  a  member  too.  So,  this  is  a  generalization  available,  which makes this type of relationship possible and naturally this is one to one.

(Refer Slide Time: 29:20)

<!-- image -->

8

So, once you have made that change, now it gets easier to write the query because you see if member class is faculty or so you have the accession number, you have the member number available from that. So, you check whether this is in student or this is in faculty, any one of them will be not null, take a union and you get the final result.

## (Refer Slide Time: 29:54)

<!-- image -->

So, this was just a quick way to show that well, you can have, you may need to extend the design by for supporting the right queries and for doing the right design. So, this is your new members design.

(Refer Slide Time: 30:11)

<!-- image -->

Similarly, your students design does not need member number anymore, because you have the roll number and member entity is taking care of that.

## (Refer Slide Time: 30:23)

<!-- image -->

Faculty also does not need the member number. So, they get simplified.

(Refer Slide Time: 30:28)

<!-- image -->

And you have finally, this relational schema that there could be more and more refinements you can do, but this is a sufficiently decent schema everything is in BCNF no redundancy in that  respect.  And at  least,  one  type  of  query  you  have  tried  out  to  sort  out  this  concept  of member  coming  in  which  was  not  explicitly  mentioned  to  be  having  so  many  different attributes.

<!-- image -->

So, this has been an example so, you please work on this, try to understand, make alternate designs  and  try  to  code  the  query  so  that  you  can  get  a  better  confidence  on  this  design process. Thank you very much for your attention and we meet in the next module to discuss further on the design of relational databases.
