Welcome to Module 29 of Database Management Systems course in the IIT Madras online BSc program.

We have been discussing about Relational Database Design. We have done that through the functional  dependency  theory  and  normal  forms  and  normalization  and  we  culminated  by discussing a specific Library Information System Design from specification to the relational schema, going through the application of each, I mean, different things that we have learned through the process. So, this brings us to kind of the learning for relational database design using functional dependency model.

So,  like  we  had  functional  dependencies  where  a  set  of  attributes  values  over  a  set  of attributes uniquely determines the values over another set of attributes, alpha determines beta. (Refer Slide Time: 01:47)

We have a more generalized scenario if we have multivalued attributes. So, far what we have dealt with we have enforced that we start with 1NF, atomic single value. So, 1NF if we start with one 1NF every attribute can have a single value, but what if it can have multiple values we saw this situation earlier too, but now, we are going to go in depth. So, we are talking about a relationship, a relational schema person who has name, phone and likeness for dogs.

Naturally the person has multiple phones a person can have multiple phones and likeness for multiple dogs. So, these are the multiple values that are possible for that attribute. Now, if they were not possible then we would have said that man functionally determines phones. But now, we cannot say that anymore.

So, what is we say we now model this saying that man multi determines mind you earlier it was functionally determines now it is multi determines phones and the change in notation is functional dependency was this and this dependency is written with two head arrows at times people  also  write  it  like  this.  So,  I  have  we  have  here  two  multi  dependencies  here multivalued dependencies here.

Multivalued dependencies in like functional dependency we say FD, multivalued dependencies we often say it is MVD. Now, if you look into this person, relational schema from the perspective of FDs there is no trivial FD and what would be the key for this? It will be all the attributes. Because nothing functionally determines anything else. So, the candidate keys man doglike phone MDP.

So, that is, that being the only key and there not being any non-trivial functional dependency, this relationship is already in BCNF. But if you look into this that there are multiple values. So, this, this relationship, relational schema is not even in 1NF, kind of contradiction. So, to make it into 1NF, what you will have to do, you will have to flatten out the multiple values as you start doing here P1 P2, P1 P2, D1 D2, D2 D1.

So, you have all possible combinations P1 D1, P1 D2, P2 D1, P2 D2, because once it gets single valued and you have to keep these values it gets into 1NF it actually still does not have any non-trivial functional dependency. So, it is in BCNF but, you can see what a tremendous amount of redundancy it has now. So, that is the new problem which cannot be handled by functional dependencies and has to be handled by the multivalued dependencies that we are going to talk about today.

Now, if we have  two independent relations,  whenever  we have  two independent  relations, say, we are talking about two independent relations here. One is student which is SID and Sname. Obvious functional dependency and other is course CID and Cname. If we have two independent relations, that is, I mean as such, there is nothing common between them I am nothing common in terms of attributes or any relationship.

But if we keep them in a single table let us say a student courses a student table is a course table,  but  if  we  keep  them  in  a  single  table  multivalued  dependency  will  happen.  Quite obviously, because, because since there is no relationship basically, when you keep them in the single table, what do you do? You do a join and in this joint, you just have a Cartesian product, there is no common attribute to filter. So, you get all of these and you get all this redundancy. And in this you have two multivalued dependencies SID multi determines CID and SID multi determines Cname. So, that is the.

<!-- image -->

I  mean this is just another perspective of the issue that example, I was trying to show. We talked  about  this  example  earlier  also,  this  is  instructor  has  multiple  children,  instructor's multiple phone numbers and keep them in different tables, but if you combine the schemas, if you have the instructors ID, you can go back to that module and see the details also.

If we combine them into instructors ID, the child's name and the phone number we will get one relationship where there is no violation of BCNF it is in BCNF but, we have MVDs, we have data duplication. So, you get to know that this person's child is David and William, but you  record  it  twice  this  phone  number  you  record  twice  and  more  and  more  you  have reexplored. Different examples and perspective we just. (Refer Slide Time: 09:12) 3

So,  having  understood  the  situation  let  us  now  formalize  it  like  we  did  for  the  functional dependency. So, what you say is if R is a relational schema and alpha beta are subsets of R, then a multivalued dependency as we write holds on R if any legal relation so that is that is always  a  common  statement.  The  for  all  pair  of  tuples  t1  and  t2  that  match  on  alpha.  In functional dependency, what do you say?

If they match on alpha, they will match on beta but it is but now it is not that it is a lot more explosive. If they match on alpha then there will exist two more tuple t3 and t4 such that all of them match on alpha, t3 and t1 match on beta, t3[R-beta] that is the remaining attributes match  with  t2s  [R-beta],  t4  beta  matches  with  t2  beta  and  so  on.  All  of  these,  looks complicated if you write down in mathematical form, but it is as such not that the example will help.

So, here is an example where I have two MVDs, course multi determines book and course multi  determines  lecturer.  A  course  may  have  multiple  so,  saying  that  a  course  may  have multiple  books  recommended  for  it  and  the  course  may  be  instructed  by  more  than  one lecturer. So, if you look into what is written here as t3 t4, what you'll find that basically what you have here you have two values each Silbertschatz, and Nederpelt.

You  have  two  values  here,  John  and  William,  but  what  you  will  get  is  you  will  get  all combinations of the Cartesian product of them and that that precisely is this definition. So, if you take these as say, if if you take that the course multi determines this. So, this is t1 this is t2.  So, they match on alphas. So, you will get two more t3 t4 who match on alpha, t3 beta should equate t1 beta.

What is t3 beta? t3, this book t3 beta should equate t1 beta t3[R-beta] will equate t3[R-beta] will equate t2[R-beta] like this. It is nothing but actually saying that all the Cartesian product items will come in here. So, that is the formal mathematical definition which can be used to reason  on  the  MVDs.  And  naturally,  as  you  have  an  MVD  on  course  to  book  you  have another MVD on course to lecture that will always be there.

(Refer Slide Time: 12:49)

So, if we have a relational schema with a set of attributes, which is partitioned into three nonempty subsets Y, Z and W, there is partition. So, together it will from form R and they are disjointed. Then you say that, if Y multi determines Z if for all possible relations, if y1 z1 w1 and y1, z2, w2 both exist in R, then the Cartesian product combinations will also exist y1 z1, w2 and y2 y1, z2 w1 that is and we decide in a different way here, this is a partition of R.

So, since it is so, so, you can clearly see that, if you if you just have such a partition, then what it will mean that if you have a MVD from Y to Z, then you will also have an MVD to Y to W. So, what we say is if you have an MVD to Y to say X some subset of R, then you will also have an MVD to Y to R-X that is the partition. So, that is what you observe in this that is that is what you saw in the previous one also. We had course to book there are three attributes course,  book and lecturer, a course to book MVD and therefore I  have a  course to lecture MVD or vice versa. So, this is a generalization of that notion.

So again, similar statements for ID and child name. If you have ID to child name you will also have child name to ID to child name will also have ID to phone number. Now, if we say that Y functionally determines Z, Y functionally determines Z, then we will always have that Y multi determined Z, because all that is happening is that the two sets are actually identical, you can consider them to be identical.

Here you are having Z you having W, they are basically identical, just two partitions. So, this is  a  golden  rule  to  understand  that  if  I  have  a  functional  dependency,  I  always  have  a corresponding multivalued dependency, but not the reverse the reverse is not true from the multivalued dependency I cannot come to functional dependence but this way it is true.

(Refer Slide Time: 15:48)

So, the how do you I mean what way do you use that possibly two ways one is test relations to determine whether they are legal under a set of functional and multivalued dependency and to specify constraints on the legal relation. Because if a relation fails to satisfy multivalued dependency, then we can always add the because those tuples are valid. But if an instance those  are  not  there,  then  we  can  always  add  those  tuples  to  satisfy  the  multivalued dependency.

Now, likely we had Armstrong's actions, we have similar inferencing rules for MVDs as well. For example, of that, a special case of this is what we have seen, in general it is if R is X multi determines Y then X multi determines R- X union Y. So, you are creating that partition. Augmentation rule of functional dependencies gets stronger because now you do not need to augment with the same set on both sides, but left side maybe augmented with a larger set and the right side could be a smaller set as well.

The transitivity takes a different look as you can see, so, these you will have to, these are not difficult, you will have to sit down take examples or take the definition and get convinced that these rules are what hold. So, if X multi determines Y and Y multi determine Z then X multi determines Z-Y. Earlier it was Z alone. Now, it is Z-Y. Similarly, for replication this we have just said, in another coalescence.

So, these are different inferencing rules like the Armstrong's actions we had for multi valued dependencies.  The  notion  of  triviality  also  changes  earlier  we  said  that  a  functional dependency is trivial, trivial, if the left-hand, right-hand side is a subset of the left-hand side. But now that holds but in addition, it is also trivial if the union of the left-hand right-hand side is a whole set. Because of you already have this kind of rule. So, by that you will say that X union Y if it is R, then it is then X multi determines Y is a trivial multivalued dependency. (Refer Slide Time: 18:43)

So,  what  we  now  get  into  actually  using  it  in  the  normalization.  So,  we  have  the  first following rule that if alpha determines beta than alpha multi determines beta. And in the same way that  we  did  the  closure of  functional  dependencies,  we  can  now do  the closure  of all functional as well as multivalued dependencies. We can compute them by using the formal definition.

In many cases, the situations of multiple values are not that complex. So, we can manage by doing simple reasoning, as we have been doing now. But if the situations are complex, then we will have to use inferencing rules that I just showed, and reason that to get to the closure of a set of functional as well as multivalued dependency and the concepts remaining concepts remain all the same. It is just that the dependency is being being relaxed in a different way.

(Refer Slide Time: 19:56)

So,  now,  we  will  define  and  show  the  decomposition  in  the  presence  of  multivalued dependency. So, like BCNF, 3NF and so on, we say that a relational schema is in 4NF. So, we have we have 1NF we have 2NF we have 3NF we have BCNF which many people call as

<!-- image -->

3.5NF and now, we have 4NF. Atomic value, partial dependency, transitive dependency and this is superkey restriction.

So,  what  do  you  how  you  define  4NF?  Say  that  with  respect  to  the  set  of  functional  and multivalued dependencies if for all multivalued dependencies in D plus that is a closure set of the form alpha multi determines beta at least one of the two will have to hold. One is either it is a trivial MVD or is a superkey, superkey of the schema.

So, only thing that you are injecting is a notion of multivalued dependency but at the end, the definition of 4NF is pretty much like BCNF and it is it will be quite obvious to see that if a relation  is  in  4NF,  it  is  necessarily  in  BCNF  because  every  functional  dependency  is  a multivalued dependency as well. So, again the conditions are, every multivalued dependency is either trivial or the left-hand side is the superkey of the schema. (Refer Slide Time: 22:08) IT Madras Restriction of Multivalued Dependencies 8

<!-- image -->

Now, to be able to check for different things, you will need to define the restriction in the same way. So, if you have decomposed a relation to Ri, then you have to restrict D the set of functional and multivalued dependencies to Di which has all the functional dependencies in D plus that include only attributes of Ri this is what we have been doing earlier. And this is the addition that  it  will  have  all  multivalued  dependencies  of the  form  beta in alpha  multi determines beta intersection Ri, where alpha is in Ri, and this is in D plus. That is quite clear.

<!-- image -->

Now, if a relationship is not in 4NF, we will again do the same we will decompose to make it into 4NF. And it goes exactly like what we did for BCNF. So, we will check using attribute closure  defined  in  the  same  way  as  we  did  for  functional  dependency.  Whether  A  multi determines  B  is  in  the  closure  set  if  it  is  not,  if  this  from  this  closure  set,  we  will  know whether it is a, A is a super key or not.

If A is not a super key, then we will have to create a decomposition and in the same way, we will  have  A union B  in  one  decomposition and  A minus B minus  in  other decomposition. Mind you the consequent observation remains same that the intersection is A and therefore you will have a lossless join. There is now no problem with that. So, this is exactly like the BCNF except that you are doing the closure in terms of the multivalued dependencies.

Now, after you  have  got  R1  and  R2,  we  have  to  check  each  if  they  are  in  4NF.  And  for checking  that  we  have  to  create  those  restrictions  D1  and  D2  and  check  within  D1,  the closure of D1 and closure of D2 and if any one or both of them are not in multivalued or not in 4NF, then I will have to again go forward and decompose it further.

(Refer Slide Time: 25:13)

<!-- image -->

So,  formally  said  this  is  the  pseudocode  of  the  algorithm,  which  you  can  go  through  and understand in steps, but what you have said is the basic process. So, you have the restrictions being computed that is the first thing, restrictions being computed, and then you are doing the checking. And based on that you do the partitioning of the relational schema.

(Refer Slide Time: 25:43)

<!-- image -->

So, now we have learned how to create 4NF so, let us look at an example. So, let us go back to  our  person  relational  schema,  all  that  I  have  done  is  I  have  included  another  attribute, which is not multivalued, it is  a single  valued, a person  has  one  address,  multiple  phones, multiple dog likes. So, there is a I mean, it is written as FD this basically dependencies.

So, first one is an MVD, man multi determines phones, can have multiple phones, can have multiple likes to dogs man multi determines dog and has a unique address naturally given this all  the  three  attributes  are  forming  the  key.  So,  here  as  you  can  see  that  all  dependencies violate 4NF because none of them are key on the left-hand side and none of them are trivial. So, what we would do?

We would use this violation and create a decomposition here which is person phone which is man  and  phone,  the  remaining  will  also  so  this  is  what  will  remain  is  person,  dog  like, address that will also violate. So, we will take this, create this and we will be left with the last one. So, here in this relation, we have one multivalued dependency in the restriction here we have  another  multivalued  dependency  in  the  restriction,  here  we  have  the  functional dependency and the restriction you can see the notations here.

FD1, FD2, FD3. So, with this normalization, the entire data schema comes into fourth normal form. So, it has minimal amount of redundancy, it naturally through the process has lossless joint  and  as  it  so  happens  that  all  the  3,  FD  or  MVD  are  shakeable  in  the  respective decomposed relation. Therefore, this is also dependency preserving decomposition into 4NF incidentally.

(Refer Slide Time: 28:29)

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

This is a longer example where we have started with considering this A, B, I mean A multi determines B which is which violates, so I have A B and I have the remaining A, C, G, H, I. Now, this is in 4NF clearly but A, C, G, H, I is not in 4NF because it will have C, G multi determines H. As we have that so we again partition C, G, H and this C, G, H is in 4NF but A, C, G, I is not.

To see that A, C, G, I is not we have to actually get into the closure of the set of functional multivalued  dependencies.  And  you  can  see  using  the  MVD  transitivity  that  there  is  a multivalued dependency A multi determining I which is available in the restriction R4. So, naturally that will get violated. So, we have to partition R4 again, I get A, I, I get A, C, G. So finally,  R1,  R3,  R5,  R6  these  four  together  give  me  a  4NF  decomposition  of  the  original relation.

<!-- image -->

So, in this module, as we conclude, we have understood the additional redundancy factors in the design of relational schema and multi valued attributes situation we have tried to address and  seen  that  I  can  all  we  can  take  a  schema  into  4NF  through  decomposition,  ensuring lossless joint, it may or may not preserve dependencies. In reality, I would say that it is much less frequent that you want users the 4NF because the prevalence of multiple valued attributes are not that huge.

Or maybe you will take care of those but they are very typical like phone number like address and so on. So, we will take care of those in that way. But this is the general founding theory for this and it is also that this does not mean that 4NF gets rid of all kinds of redundancies. There are other types of redundancies like joint redundancy and so on for each 5NF and so on so forth.

There  are  several  other  normal  forms  higher  and  higher,  which  removes  more  and  more redundancies. But we will stop here on the theory of design of relational databases, because those are not very frequently used. Thank you very much for your attention and we meet in the next module.
